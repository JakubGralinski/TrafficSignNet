**TrafficSignNet** is a deep learning project aimed at classifying traffic signs using a convolutional neural network (CNN) built with TensorFlow and Keras. This project utilizes the [German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB)](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=news) dataset, which contains over 43 categories of traffic signs. The model is trained to detect and classify these signs based on images.
